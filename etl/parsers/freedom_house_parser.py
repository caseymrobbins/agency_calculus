"""
Component: etl/parsers/freedom_house_parser.py
Purpose: Parser for the Freedom House "Freedom in the World" dataset.
         Specifically targets the Political Rights (PR) score and normalizes it.
Inputs: Path to the Freedom House Excel file.
Outputs: A list of observation dictionaries in the standard format for ingestion.
Integration: Called by the etl/etl_bulk.py script.

    """
    Parses the Freedom House "Country and Territory Ratings and Statuses" Excel file.

    Methodology:
    1.  Loads the Excel file, which often contains multiple header rows.
    2.  Identifies the relevant columns: Country/Territory, Year, and PR (Political Rights).
    3.  Normalizes the Political Rights score from its native 0-40 scale to the
        project's standard 0-100 scale, as required by the data sourcing plan.
        The formula used is: political_freedom_index = (PR_score / 40) * 100.
    4.  Transforms the data into a long format with a consistent indicator_code.
    5.  Handles variations in country names and ensures data cleanliness.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The full path to the Freedom House Excel file.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries, each representing a
                               single observation record for the political_freedom_index.
